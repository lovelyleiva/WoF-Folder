Welcome everyone, I'm your host, Pat Sajak.........'s biggest fan, Stephanie Leiva!

Welcome to the *drumroll*
!!  WHEEL   OF  FORTUNE    !!

You know the rules. Three players take round guessing the mystery word.
Each turn, they have the option to 
1) buy a vowel for $250, if they can afford it
2) spin the wheel to guess a consonant (or go bankrupt or lose a turn)
3) guess the entire word

There are two rounds. 
At the end of the round, the player with the most money keeps their bank, and the other two start back at 0 for round 2.
At the end of round 2, the player with the most money moves to the final round.

*oohs from the audience*

In the last round, we will give R-S-T-L-N-E, the most common letters in the alphabet. 
The player then can choose 3 consonants and one vowel and has FIVE SECONDS TO ANSWER.
If the player guesses correctly and in time, the player will win.....*drumroll*

!!  THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS    !!

*audience goes bananas*

Now, who's ready to play the...
!!  WHEEL   OF  FORTUNE    !!
